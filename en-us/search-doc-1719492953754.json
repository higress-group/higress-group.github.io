Users face the risk of data leakage in the process of providing prompts. Ensuring data security in the process of using the AIGC application is also an important issue for API callers. Protecting data security involves stringent control over the API calling channels. One method involves confirming specifically approved models with their published API. Another way is to intercept user requests containing sensitive information. These can be achieved by setting specific request interception at the gateway level.

With the evolution of the application architecture model from a single body to the current distributed micro-service, the business gateway also has a new name - micro-service gateway ( Illustrations are shown below).

The traffic gateway is responsible for north-south traffic scheduling and security protection, and the microservice gateway is responsible for east-west traffic scheduling and service governance. In the cloud-native era dominated by K8s, Ingress has become the gateway standard of the K8s ecosystem, endowing the gateway with a new mission and making it possible to combine traffic gateway + microservice gateway into one. As a north-south public network gateway, it is a common requirement to use Waf to protect abnormal traffic. As the Internet environment becomes more and more complex, users' demands for protection continue to increase. The conventional method is to access the traffic first. The Waf security gateway, after filtering, forwards the traffic to the traffic gateway, and finally reaches the microservice gateway; Higress hopes that through the built-in Waf module, the user's request link can be simultaneously completed Waf protection, traffic distribution, and microservice governance only through Higress. It can improve the link RT and reduce the operation and maintenance complexity of the gateway.

Token-based authentication​","type":1,"pageTitle":"JWT authentication","url":"/en-us/docs/plugins/authentication/jwt-auth#1-token-based-authentication","content":"1.1 Introduction​ Many open APIs need to identify the identity of the caller and determine whether the requested resource can be returned to the caller based on this identity. Token is a mechanism used for identity verification. Based on this mechanism, the application does not need to retain the user's authentication information or session information on the server, which can realize stateless and distributed web application authorization and provide convenience for application extension. 1.2 Process Description​ The above figure is the business process sequence diagram when the gateway uses JWT for authentication, and the following we will describe the steps marked in the figure in detail in words: The client initiates an authentication request to the API gateway, usually carrying the end user's username and password in the request; The gateway forwards the request directly to the backend service; The backend service reads the authentication information (such as the username and password) in the request for verification. After the verification is passed, it uses the private key to generate a standard token and returns it to the gateway; The gateway returns the response with the token to the client, and the client needs to cache this token locally; The client sends a business request to the API gateway, carrying the token in the request; The gateway uses the public key set by the user to verify the token in the request. After the verification is passed, the request is passed through to the backend service; The backend service processes the business and responds; The gateway returns the business response to the client. In this entire process, the gateway uses the token authentication mechanism to realize the ability of users to use their own user system to authorize their API. Next, we will introduce the structured token JSON Web Token (JWT) used by the gateway to implement token authentication. 1.3 JWT​ 1.3.1 Introduction​ JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard RFC7519 based on JSON for executing a type of claim to pass between network applications. JWT can generally be used as an independent identity verification token, which can contain user identification, user roles, and permissions information, making it easier to obtain resources from the resource server, and can also add some other necessary declarative information for other business logic, especially suitable for the login scenario of distributed sites. 1.3.2 Composition of JWT​ eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ As shown in the example above, JWT is a string consisting of three parts: HeaderPayloadSignature Header The header of the JWT carries two pieces of information: The type of the token, which is JWTThe algorithm used for encryption The gateway supports the following encryption algorithms: ES256, ES384, ES512, HS256, HS384, HS512, RS256, RS384, RS512, PS256, PS384, PS512, EdDSA  The complete header looks like the following JSON: { 'typ': 'JWT', 'alg': 'HS256' }  The header is then Base64-encoded (this encoding can be symmetrically decoded), forming the first part: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 Payload The payload is where the actual information is stored. The details are defined below: iss: The issuer of the token. This indicates who created the token and is a string value. sub: The subject identifier. This is the unique identifier for the end user provided by the issuer, and is no longer than 255 ASCII characters, and is case-sensitive within the issuer's scope. aud: The audience(s) of the token, which is an array of case-sensitive strings. exp: The expiration time of the token, after which the token will be invalidated, is an integer declaration representing the Unix timestamp in seconds. iat: The issuance time of the token, is an integer declaration representing the Unix timestamp in seconds. jti: The unique identifier of the token, and the value is unique for every token created by the issuer. It is usually a cryptographically random value to prevent conflicts. This component adds a random entropy that an attacker cannot obtain to the structured token, making it more difficult for the token to be guessed or replayed.  Custom fields for a user feature can also be added, such as the example below adding a &quot;name&quot; field for the user's nickname: { &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot; }  The payload is then Base64-encoded, forming the second part of the JWT: JTdCJTBBJTIwJTIwJTIyc3ViJTIyJTNBJTIwJTIyMTIzNDU2Nzg5MCUyMiUyQyUwQSUyMCUyMCUyMm5hbWUlMjIlM0ElMjAlMjJKb2huJTIwRG9lJTIyJTBBJTdE Signature This part is a string that consists of the Base64-encoded header and Base64-encoded payload concatenated with a period, followed by the encryption of the resulting string using the algorithm specified in the header (where $secret represents the user's private key). var encodedString = base64UrlEncode(header) + '.' + base64UrlEncode(payload); var signature = HMACSHA256(encodedString, '$secret');  These three parts are then concatenated using periods to form the complete JWT string as shown in the example at the beginning of this section. 1.3.3 Time validity​ The gateway will verify the exp field in the token. Once this field has expired, the gateway will consider the token invalid and reject the request directly. The expiration time value must be set. 1.3.4 Several Characteristics of JWT​ By default, JWT is not encrypted and cannot write secret data into JWT.JWT can not only be used for authentication but also for exchanging information. Using JWT effectively can reduce the number of times servers query the database.The biggest drawback of JWT is that the server cannot invalidate a token during use, or change the token's permission, because the server does not keep the session state. That is, once JWT is issued, it will always be valid before it expires, unless the server deploys additional logic.JWT contains authentication information itself. Once leaked, anyone can obtain all permissions of the token. To reduce theft, the expiration time of JWT should be set relatively short. For some more important permissions, users should be authenticated again when using them.To reduce theft, JWT should not be transmitted in plaintext using the HTTP protocol, and the HTTPS protocol should be used for transmission.

The private key is used for the authorization service to issue JWT, and the public key is configured into the JWT plugin for the gateway to verify the signature of the request. Note that the JWKs format configuration used by the gateway requires the public key in the figure below to be placed in the keys structure, such as: {&quot;keys&quot;:[{&quot;kty&quot;:&quot;RSA&quot;,&quot;e&quot;:&quot;AQAB&quot;,...}]}  Method 2: Generate locally This article uses a Java example to illustrate, and users of other languages can also find relevant tools to generate key pairs. Create a new Maven project and add the following dependencies: &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;org.bitbucket.b_c&lt;/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;jose4j&lt;/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;0.7.0&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt;  Use the following code to generate a pair of RSA keys: RsaJsonWebKey rsaJsonWebKey = RsaJwkGenerator.generateJwk(2048); final String publicKeyString = rsaJsonWebKey.toJson(JsonWebKey.OutputControlLevel.PUBLIC_ONLY); final String privateKeyString = rsaJsonWebKey.toJson(JsonWebKey.OutputControlLevel.INCLUDE_PRIVATE);  2.2 Implement the token issuance authentication service using the private key in JWK​ The Keypair JSON string generated online in Section 2.1 (the first of the three boxes) or privateKeyString JSON string generated locally needs to be used as the private key to issue tokens for trusted users to access protected APIs. The specific implementation can refer to the following example. The form of issuing tokens to customers is determined by the user according to the specific business scenario. The function of issuing tokens can be deployed in the production environment and configured as a normal API for visitors to obtain through username and password, or tokens can be generated directly in the local environment and copied to designated users for use. import java.security.PrivateKey; import org.jose4j.json.JsonUtil; import org.jose4j.jwk.RsaJsonWebKey; import org.jose4j.jwk.RsaJwkGenerator; import org.jose4j.jws.AlgorithmIdentifiers; import org.jose4j.jws.JsonWebSignature; import org.jose4j.jwt.JwtClaims; import org.jose4j.jwt.NumericDate; import org.jose4j.lang.JoseException; public class GenerateJwtDemo { public static void main(String[] args) throws JoseException { String keyId = &quot;uniq_key&quot;; //Use the Keypair generated in section 2.1 of this article String privateKeyJson = &quot;{\\n&quot; + &quot; \\&quot;kty\\&quot;: \\&quot;RSA\\&quot;,\\n&quot; + &quot; \\&quot;d\\&quot;: &quot; + &quot;\\&quot;O9MJSOgcjjiVMNJ4jmBAh0mRHF_TlaVva70Imghtlgwxl8BLfcf1S8ueN1PD7xV6Cnq8YenSKsfiNOhC6yZ_fjW1syn5raWfj68eR7cjHWjLOvKjwVY33GBPNOvspNhVAFzeqfWneRTBbga53Agb6jjN0SUcZdJgnelzz5JNdOGaLzhacjH6YPJKpbuzCQYPkWtoZHDqWTzCSb4mJ3n0NRTsWy7Pm8LwG_Fd3pACl7JIY38IanPQDLoighFfo-Lriv5z3IdlhwbPnx0tk9sBwQBTRdZ8JkqqYkxUiB06phwr7mAnKEpQJ6HvhZBQ1cCnYZ_nIlrX9-I7qomrlE1UoQ\\&quot;,\\n&quot; + &quot; \\&quot;e\\&quot;: \\&quot;AQAB\\&quot;,\\n&quot; + &quot; \\&quot;alg\\&quot;: \\&quot;RS256\\&quot;,\\n&quot; + &quot; \\&quot;n\\&quot;: \\&quot;vCuB8MgwPZfziMSytEbBoOEwxsG7XI3MaVMoocziP4SjzU4IuWuE_DodbOHQwb_thUru57_Efe&quot; + &quot;--sfATHEa0Odv5ny3QbByqsvjyeHk6ZE4mSAV9BsHYa6GWAgEZtnDceeeDc0y76utXK2XHhC1Pysi2KG8KAzqDa099Yh7s31AyoueoMnrYTmWfEyDsQL_OAIiwgXakkS5U8QyXmWicCwXntDzkIMh8MjfPskesyli0XQD1AmCXVV3h2Opm1Amx0ggSOOiINUR5YRD6mKo49_cN-nrJWjtwSouqDdxHYP-4c7epuTcdS6kQHiQERBd1ejdpAxV4c0t0FHF7MOy9kw\\&quot;\\n&quot; + &quot;}&quot;; JwtClaims claims = new JwtClaims(); claims.setGeneratedJwtId(); claims.setIssuedAtToNow(); //Expiration time must be set NumericDate date = NumericDate.now(); date.addSeconds(120*60); claims.setExpirationTime(date); claims.setNotBeforeMinutesInThePast(1); claims.setSubject(&quot;YOUR_SUBJECT&quot;); claims.setAudience(&quot;YOUR_AUDIENCE&quot;); //Add custom parameters, use String type for all values claims.setClaim(&quot;userId&quot;, &quot;1213234&quot;); claims.setClaim(&quot;email&quot;, &quot;userEmail@youapp.com&quot;); JsonWebSignature jws = new JsonWebSignature(); jws.setAlgorithmHeaderValue(AlgorithmIdentifiers.RSA_USING_SHA256); jws.setKeyIdHeaderValue(keyId); jws.setPayload(claims.toJson()); PrivateKey privateKey = new RsaJsonWebKey(JsonUtil.parseJson(privateKeyJson)).getPrivateKey(); jws.setKey(privateKey); String jwtResult = jws.getCompactSerialization(); System.out.println(&quot;Generate Json Web token , result is &quot; + jwtResult); } }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Plugin Configuration Guide​","type":1,"pageTitle":"JWT authentication","url":"/en-us/docs/plugins/authentication/jwt-auth#plugin-configuration-guide","content":"","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Configuration Fields​","type":1,"pageTitle":"JWT authentication","url":"/en-us/docs/plugins/authentication/jwt-auth#configuration-fields","content":"Name\tData Type\tRequired\tDefault\tDescriptionconsumers\tarray of object\tYes\t-\tConfigures callers of the service for authenticating requests _rules_\tarray of object\tOptional\t-\tConfigures access control lists for specific routes or domains for authorizing requests The configuration field descriptions for each item in consumers are as follows: Name\tData Type\tRequired\tDefault\tDescriptionname\tstring\tYes\t-\tConfigures the name of this consumer jwks\tstring\tYes\t-\tSpecifies a JSON Web Key Set, as defined in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517, consisting of public keys (or symmetric keys) used to verify the signature of JWT issuer\tstring\tYes\t-\tThe issuer of the JWT, which should be consistent with the iss field in the payload claims_to_headers\tarray of object\tOptional\t-\tExtracts the specified fields from the JWT's payload and sets them to the specified request headers for forwarding to the backend from_headers\tarray of object\tOptional\t{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Authorization&quot;,&quot;value_prefix&quot;:&quot;Bearer &quot;}\tExtracts the JWT from the specified request headers from_params\tarray of string\tOptional\taccess_token\tExtracts the JWT from the specified URL parameters from_cookies\tarray of string\tOptional\t-\tExtracts the JWT from the specified cookie(s) clock_skew_seconds\tnumber\tOptional\t60\tThe amount of clock skew, in seconds, that is allowed when verifying the exp and iat fields of the JWT keep_token\tbool\tOptional\ttrue\tWhether to keep the JWT when forwarding it to the backend Note: The default value is used only if neither from_headers, from_params, nor from_cookies are configured.

Using encryption algorithms and the configured secret to encrypt the key data signing string and obtain a signature. Adding all headers related to the signature to the original HTTP request to obtain the final HTTP request. As shown below : Process for Extracting Signing String​ To generate a signature, the client needs to extract key data from the HTTP request and combine it into a signing string. The format of the generated signing string is as follows: HTTPMethod Accept Content-MD5 Content-Type Date Headers PathAndParameters  The signing string consists of the above 7 fields separated by \\n. If Headers is empty, no \\n is needed. If other fields are empty, the \\n should still be retained. The signature is case-sensitive. Below are the rules for extracting each field: HTTPMethod: The HTTP method used in the request, in all capital letters, such as POST. Accept: The value of the Accept header in the request, which can be empty. It is recommended to explicitly set the Accept header. When Accept is empty, some HTTP clients will set the default value of */*, which may cause signature verification to fail. Content-MD5: The value of the Content-MD5 header in the request, which can be empty. It is only calculated when there is a non-form body in the request. The following is a reference calculation method for Content-MD5 values in ： String content-MD5 = Base64.encodeBase64(MD5(bodyStream.getbytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;)));  Content-Type: The value of the Content-Type header in the request, which can be empty. Date: The value of the Date header in the request. When the date_offset configuration is not enabled, it can be empty. Otherwise, it will be used for time offset verification. Headers: Users can select specific headers to participate in the signature. There are the following rules for concatenating the signature string with headers: The keys of the headers participating in the signature calculation are sorted in alphabetical order and concatenated as follows: HeaderKey1 + &quot;:&quot; + HeaderValue1 + &quot;\\n&quot;\\+ HeaderKey2 + &quot;:&quot; + HeaderValue2 + &quot;\\n&quot;\\+ ... HeaderKeyN + &quot;:&quot; + HeaderValueN + &quot;\\n&quot; If the value of a header is empty, it will participate in the signature with the HeaderKey+&quot;:&quot;+&quot;\\n&quot; only, and the key and english colon should be retained.The set of keys for all headers participating in the signature is separated by a comma and placed in the X-Ca-Signature-Headers header.The following headers are not included in the header signature calculation: X-Ca-Signature, X-Ca-Signature-Headers, Accept, Content-MD5, Content-Type, Date. PathAndParameters: This field contains all parameters in the path, query, and form. The specific format is as follows: Path + &quot;?&quot; + Key1 + &quot;=&quot; + Value1 + &quot;&amp;&quot; + Key2 + &quot;=&quot; + Value2 + ... &quot;&amp;&quot; + KeyN + &quot;=&quot; + ValueN  Notes: The keys of the query and form parameter pairs are sorted alphabetically, and the same format as above is used for concatenation.If there are no query and form parameters, use the path directly without adding ? .If the value of a parameter is empty, only the key will be included in the signature. The equal sign should not be included in the signature.If there are array parameters in the query or form (parameters with the same key but different values), only the first value should be included in the signature calculation. Example of Extracting Signing String​ The initial HTTP request : POST /http2test/test?param1=test HTTP/1.1 host:api.aliyun.com accept:application/json; charset=utf-8 ca_version:1 content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8 x-ca-timestamp:1525872629832 date:Wed, 09 May 2018 13:30:29 GMT+00:00 user-agent:ALIYUN-ANDROID-DEMO x-ca-nonce:c9f15cbf-f4ac-4a6c-b54d-f51abf4b5b44 content-length:33 username=xiaoming&amp;password=123456789  The correct generated signature string is : POST application/json; charset=utf-8 application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8 Wed, 09 May 2018 13:30:29 GMT+00:00 x-ca-key:203753385 x-ca-nonce:c9f15cbf-f4ac-4a6c-b54d-f51abf4b5b44 x-ca-signature-method:HmacSHA256 x-ca-timestamp:1525872629832 /http2test/test?param1=test&amp;password=123456789&amp;username=xiaoming  Signature Calculation Process​ After extracting the key data from the HTTP request and assembling it into a signature string, the client needs to encrypt and encode the signature string to form the final signature. The specific encryption format is as follows, where stringToSign is the extracted signature string, secret is the one filled in the plugin configuration, and sign is the final generated signature: Mac hmacSha256 = Mac.getInstance(&quot;HmacSHA256&quot;); byte[] secretBytes = secret.getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;); hmacSha256.init(new SecretKeySpec(secretBytes, 0, secretBytes.length, &quot;HmacSHA256&quot;)); byte[] result = hmacSha256.doFinal(stringToSign.getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;)); String sign = Base64.encodeBase64String(result);  In summary, the stringToSign is decoded using UTF-8 to obtain a Byte array. Then, an encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the Byte array, and finally, the Base64 algorithm is used to encode the encrypted data, resulting in the final signature. The Process of Adding a Signature​ The client needs to include the following four headers in the HTTP request to be transmitted to the API gateway for signature verification: x-ca-key: The value is the APP Key and is required. x-ca-signature-method: The signature algorithm, the value can be HmacSHA256 or HmacSHA1, optional. The default value is HmacSHA256. x-ca-signature-headers: The collection of keys for all signature headers, separated by commas. Optional. x-ca-signature: The signature and it is required. Here is an example of a complete HTTP request with a signature : POST /http2test/test?param1=test HTTP/1.1 host:api.aliyun.com accept:application/json; charset=utf-8 ca_version:1 content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8 x-ca-timestamp:1525872629832 date:Wed, 09 May 2018 13:30:29 GMT+00:00 user-agent:ALIYUN-ANDROID-DEMO x-ca-nonce:c9f15cbf-f4ac-4a6c-b54d-f51abf4b5b44 x-ca-key:203753385 x-ca-signature-method:HmacSHA256 x-ca-signature-headers:x-ca-timestamp,x-ca-key,x-ca-nonce,x-ca-signature-method x-ca-signature:xfX+bZxY2yl7EB/qdoDy9v/uscw3Nnj1pgoU+Bm6xdM= content-length:33 username=xiaoming&amp;password=123456789  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Server-side Signature Verification Method​","type":1,"pageTitle":"HMAC authentication","url":"/en-us/docs/plugins/authentication/hmac-auth#server-side-signature-verification-method","content":"Overview of the Process​ The server-side signature verification of the client's request involves four steps : Extract crucial data from the received request to obtain a string for signing.

Or if you have curl installed, use the following commands: curl.exe -LO &quot;https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.27.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe&quot; curl.exe -Lo kind-windows-amd64.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.18.0/kind-windows-amd64  Note: To find out the latest stable version of kubectl (for example, for scripting), take a look at https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt. Then rename downloaded kind-windows-amd64 or kind-windows-amd64.exe to kind.exe. And move both exe files to a file location on your system PATH.
