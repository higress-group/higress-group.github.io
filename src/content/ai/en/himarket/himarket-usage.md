### Import Higress Instance
Before starting to create API Products, you need to import a Higress gateway instance as the underlying gateway for AI resources.

**Operation Steps:**

1. Log in to the management console
2. Navigate to [Instance Management] → [Gateway Instances]
3. Click the [Import Gateway Instance] button
4. Select [Higress Gateway]

### Create Portal
A Portal is a site for external developers. Administrators can create multiple portals, each with independent configuration and API products.

**Operation Steps:**

1. Navigate to the [Portal] menu
2. Click the [Create Portal] button
3. Fill in basic portal information:
    - Portal Name: e.g., `himarket-demo`

<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178d4644-eee2-488e-9cac-f76a7cad9a7f)

</div>

**Portal Configuration Description:**

After creating a portal, click the portal card to enter the detailed configuration page, which mainly includes the following functions:

#### 1. Overview
+ Portal basic information: name, description, login method, approval policy, etc.
+ Statistics:
    - Number of published API products
    - Number of registered developers

#### 2. Products (Published API Products)
+ Manage API products published in the current portal
+ View product details
+ Remove or update published products

#### 3. Developers (Developer Management)
+ View and manage developers registered in this portal
+ Approve developer registration applications
+ Manage Consumers associated with developers
+ View developer subscription status

#### 4. Security (Security Settings)
User login configuration:

+ Username/Password Login: Traditional username and password method (enabled by default)
+ OIDC Login: Supports third-party identity authentication (such as enterprise SSO)

Approval process configuration:

+ Developer Registration Approval: Choose whether to automatically approve developer registration applications
    - Automatic Approval: Developer registration takes effect immediately
    - Manual Approval: Requires administrator approval in the backend before use
+ API Product Subscription Approval: Choose whether to automatically approve subscription applications
    - Automatic Approval: Developer subscription requests take effect immediately
    - Manual Approval: Requires administrator approval before calling API Products

#### 5. Domain (Domain Management)
+ The system automatically assigns a default domain for each portal
+ Additional custom domains can be bound (e.g., binding `localhost` for local development)

**Notes:**

+ Domains require self-configuration of DNS resolution or hosts file to point to the himarket-frontend service
+ Portals use multi-tenant design, identifying different portal instances through domains
+ For local development, it's recommended to bind the `localhost` domain for easy testing
+ For production environments, it's recommended to configure real domain names and DNS resolution

## HiMarket Developer Portal
The developer portal is a self-service platform for external developers, where developers can register, browse API products, apply for subscriptions, and initiate calls.

### Access Portal
HiMarket portals use **multi-tenant design**, identifying different portal instances through domain names.

**Access Methods:**

1. **Use Default Domain:**
    - Each portal is automatically assigned a default domain
    - For example: `portal-68ac4564bdb292ee9261ff4a.api.portal.local`
    - Requires DNS resolution or hosts file configuration to point the domain to the himarket-frontend service
2. **Use Custom Domain:**
    - Custom domain bound by administrators in the backend
    - For example, `localhost` bound for local development
    - Access: `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Use himarket-frontend Service IP:**
    - Using the himarket-frontend service IP will access the "Default Portal", which is the first portal created
    - For local development environment, access `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

---

### Register Developer
Developers need to register an account in the portal first to browse and subscribe to API products.

**Registration Steps:**

1. Access the portal homepage
2. Click the [Register] button
3. Fill in developer information:
    - Username: Unique developer identifier
    - Password: Set login password
4. Click [Register] to submit application

<div align="center">

</div>

**Registration Approval:**

The status after registration depends on the portal configuration:

+ Automatic Approval Mode: Registration takes effect immediately, can log in directly
+ Manual Approval Mode: Registration requires administrator approval
    - Cannot log in to portal before approval
    - Administrators approve in the backend [Developers] menu

<div align="center">

### Create Consumer
In HiMarket's design:

+ Developer: Represents user identity, used for login and management

One Developer can create multiple Consumers for different application scenarios (such as development environment, test environment, production environment). Each Developer is automatically assigned a Consumer after registration and supports creating new Consumers.

**Creation Steps:**

1. Log in to the developer portal
2. Click the avatar in the upper right corner and navigate to [Consumer Management]

<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6af8fd64-7755-40ec-8abd-3158fae59e8f)

</div>

3. Click the [Add Consumer] button
4. Fill in consumer information:
    - Consumer Name: Used to identify this consumer (e.g., `my-app-prod`)
    - Description: Brief explanation of purpose (e.g., production environment application)
5. Click [Submit]

<div align="center">

1. Select the API product to subscribe to
2. Click the [Subscribe] button on the product details page
3. Select the Consumer to use
4. Click [Confirm Subscription]

<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d6dc5d3-8a1c-4dc4-9843-59f79b33b583)

</div>

**Subscription Approval:**

+ Automatic Approval: Takes effect immediately after submission, can directly call API Product
+ Manual Approval: Need to wait for administrator approval

**Description:**

+ Subscription status can be viewed in the [Subscription List] of Consumer details
+ After successful subscription, you can use the Consumer's credentials to call the corresponding API Product
+ You can cancel subscription at any time

### HiChat
HiMarket provides the HiChat AI Innovation Center for quickly applying AI resources, such as conversing with models and calling MCP Servers with models.

**Call Models and MCP:**

1. Log in to the developer portal
2. Navigate to the [HiChat] page

<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f324e384-845e-4201-9ca4-2ebd3ab75350)

</div>

3. Select the model product to test, you can converse with this model, and during the conversation, you can choose to combine with MCP Server
4. Note:
    - Models and MCP Servers need to be subscribed to before they can be accessed normally. HiMarket HiChat uses the Developer's default Consumer by default. You need to use the default Consumer to subscribe to corresponding API Products
    - Developers can configure the default Consumer in the [Consumer Management] page
5. Operation Example:
    - Select model and MCP Server

<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8b0d691-2dc7-47d7-9b42-c2cf8d43f40c)

</div>

+ Specify and subscribe to MCP Server. Quick subscription will use the default Consumer to execute subscription operations

<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8088532d-b419-4d33-86d2-23c80edbe8ad)

</div>

+ Converse with model
