# Viewing Logs

## Viewing Component Logs

### Kubernetes Deployment

Use the `kubectl logs` command to view logs. For example:

```bash
kubectl logs -n higress-system higress-gateway-5cb7f44768-snfbd
```

Note that the `higress-controller` pod contains two containers: `higress-core` and `discovery`, which correspond to the `controller` and `pilot` components respectively. Use the `-c` parameter to specify the container name when viewing logs. For example:

```bash
kubectl logs -n higress-system higress-controller-5c768d64d9-m5gtp -c discovery
```

### Docker Compose Deployment

In the installation directory, execute `./bin/logs.sh component-name` to view logs for the specified component.

Common component names include:

- apiserver
- controller
- pilot
- gateway
- console

### All-in-One Container Deployment

In all-in-one mode, all Higress log files are stored in the `/var/log/higress` directory inside the container. Use `docker exec` to access the container and view the files directly:

```bash
docker exec -it higress-ai-gateway bash

cd /var/log/higress
ls -l
cat gateway.log
```

## Viewing Access Logs

### With Built-in Monitoring Suite Enabled

If you have enabled Higress's built-in monitoring suite, you can view request logs directly in the Higress Console:

1. Navigate to the Monitoring Dashboard in Higress Console
2. Click the "four small squares" icon in the top-left corner of the monitoring area
3. Click "Higress Access Logs" to access the access logs dashboard

### Without Built-in Monitoring Suite

When the built-in monitoring suite is not enabled, access logs are recorded together with runtime logs. Refer to the runtime logs viewing methods above.

## Adjusting Log Levels

Currently, the main component that may require log level adjustments is the gateway. To temporarily adjust log levels:

1. Open a bash terminal in the gateway container:
   - K8s deployment: `kubectl exec -it higress-gateway-xxxx-yyyyy -n higress-system -- bash`
   - Docker Compose: `docker exec -it higress-gateway-1 bash`
   - All-in-one container: `docker exec -it higress-ai-gateway bash`

2. Execute the command: `curl localhost:15000/logging?module=log_level -X POST`

Common module names include:

- `golang`: MCP Server module
- `wasm`: Wasm plugin module

Available log levels:

- `trace`
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warning` or `warn` (default)
- `error`
- `critical`
- `off`

Note: Log level changes will be reset when the gateway restarts.
