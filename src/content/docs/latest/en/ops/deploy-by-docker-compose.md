# Standalone Deployment with Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With it, we can use YAML files to deploy Higress gateway standalone without a K8s cluster.

> **Note**
> 
> The Standalone mode has not been extensively used in large-scale production environments. It is currently mainly used for local deployment and testing scenarios. For production deployments, the [Cloud-Native mode](https://higress.io/en/docs/ops/deploy-by-helm) is more recommended.

## Installing Higress

When deploying with Docker Compose, the Higress gateway consists of the following services:
- apiserver: Infrastructure service. Responsible for simulating the K8s API Server.
- controller: Control plane service one. Responsible for collecting and integrating all configuration data and service lists.
- pilot: Control plane service two. Responsible for distributing gateway routing data.
- gateway: Data plane service. Responsible for handling actual gateway requests.
- console: Higress gateway control console.

### Installation Command

```shell
curl -fsSL https://higress.io/standalone/get-higress.sh | bash -s -- [DESTINATION] [OPTIONS...]
```
