#Higress Terminology

## Ingress Annotation (Annotation)

The annotation (Annotation) field in the Ingress resource is a kv dictionary structure, which can implement various routing strategies in a declarative manner. As shown below, annotations are used to enable cross-domain access permission for the Ingress route:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
   name: ingress-example
   annotations:
     higress.io/enable-cors: "true"
spec:
   ingressClassName: nginx-example
   rules:
   - http:
       paths:
       - path: /test
         pathType: Prefix
         backend:
           service:
             name: test
             port:
               number: 80
```
