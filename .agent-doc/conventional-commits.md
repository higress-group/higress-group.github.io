# Conventional Commits 1.0.0

## Summary

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history;
which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org),
by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

---

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
---

<br />
The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the
consumers of your library:

1. **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
1. _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `build:`, `chore:`,
  `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
1. _footers_ other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to
  [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).
<br /><br />
A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

## Examples

### Commit message with description and breaking change footer
```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

### Commit message with `!` to draw attention to breaking change
```
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

### Commit message with scope and `!` to draw attention to breaking change
```
feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

### Commit message with both `!` and BREAKING CHANGE footer
```
chore!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.
```

### Commit message with no body
```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

### Commit message with scope
```
feat(lang): add Polish language
```

### Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers
```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, `feat`, `fix`, etc., followed
  by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL `!`, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
1. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
1. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
1. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a
  section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(parser):`
1. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix.
The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., _fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string_.
1. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
1. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
1. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of
 a word token, followed by either a `:<space>` or `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the
  [git trailer convention](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers)).
1. A footer's token MUST use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g., `Acked-by` (this helps differentiate
  the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which MAY also be used as a token.
1. A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer
  token/separator pair is observed.
1. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the
  footer.
1. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g.,
_BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files_.
1. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a
  `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` MAY be omitted from the footer section,
  and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
1. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., _docs: update ref docs._
1. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
1. BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.

## 1. Component Structure

All new and refactored components within `src/components/` must adhere to the following directory structure:

### Requirement
Every component must reside in its own dedicated directory named after the component (in kebab-case or PascalCase matching the component, preferred lowercase for directory if generic, or PascalCase if strictly enforced by framework, but here we use **kebab-case** or **camelCase** directories for grouping, e.g., `src/components/select/`).

### Structure
```
src/components/
└── <component-name-dir>/
    ├── <ComponentName>.astro  (The source code)
    └── README.md              (Documentation)
```

**Example:**
For a component named `Switcher`:
```
src/components/switcher/
├── Switcher.astro
└── README.md
```

## 2. Documentation Standards

The `README.md` file accompanying each component is **mandatory**. It must contain:

### A. Usage Documentation
- **Description**: A brief summary of what the component does.
- **Props**: A table or list of all accepted props, their types, default values, and descriptions.
- **Code Examples**: Clear snippets showing how to import and use the component in an `.astro` file.

### B. Implementation Details (Realization)
- **Architecture**: How the component is built (e.g., Web Component, pure CSS, React wrapper).
- **Key Logic**: Explanations of complex parts (e.g., "The slider width is calculated via JS on mount to prevent layout thrashing").
- **Theming**: How the component handles light/dark mode (e.g., "Uses CSS variables `--sl-color-*`").
- **Accessibility**: Notes on ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.

## 3. General Style
- **Theming**: Always use the project's global CSS variables (defined in `src/styles/global.css`) for colors. Avoid hardcoded hex values unless defining a specific new theme variable.
- **Tailwind**: Use Tailwind utility classes where possible, but encapsulated `<style>` blocks are permitted for complex component-specific logic (like the Switcher's sliding track).
lexibility of _types_ and _footers_ to develop their logic for handling reverts.

One recommendation is to use the `revert` type, and a footer that references the commit SHAs that are being reverted:

```
revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident
