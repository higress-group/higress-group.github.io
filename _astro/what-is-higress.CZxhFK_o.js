# What Is Higress?

 Higress is a next-generation cloud-native gateway built on the core of open-source Istio + Envoy based on Alibaba's internal Envoy Gateway practice. It realizes the high integration capability of three-in-one traffic gateway + microservice gateway + security gateway, and deeply integrates Dubbo and Nacos , Sentinel and other micro-service technology stacks can help users greatly reduce the cost of gateway deployment and operation and maintenance without compromising capabilities; fully support Ingress and Gateway APIs in terms of standards, and actively embrace the standard API specifications under cloud native; at the same time, Higress The Controller also supports smooth migration of Nginx Ingress, helping users quickly migrate to Higress at zero cost.

## Classification of traditional gateways

In the industry, gateways are usually divided into two categories: traffic gateways and business gateways. Traffic gateways mainly provide global policy configurations that have nothing to do with back-end business. For example, Ali\u2019s internal unified access gateway Tengine is a typical traffic gateway. As the name suggests, the business gateway mainly provides independent business domain-level, tightly coupled policy configuration with the back-end business. With the evolution of the application architecture model from a single body to the current distributed micro-service, the business gateway also has a new name - micro-service gateway ( Illustrations are shown below). In the current cloud-native era dominated by container technology and K8s, is the next-generation gateway model still the same?

## Positioning

Under the microservice architecture in the virtualization era, the business usually adopts a two-tier architecture of traffic gateway + microservice gateway. The traffic gateway is responsible for north-south traffic scheduling and security protection, and the microservice gateway is responsible for east-west traffic scheduling and service governance. In the cloud-native era dominated by K8s, Ingress has become the gateway standard of the K8s ecosystem, endowing the gateway with a new mission and making it possible to combine traffic gateway + microservice gateway into one.

As a north-south public network gateway, it is a common requirement to use Waf to protect abnormal traffic. As the Internet environment becomes more and more complex, users' demands for protection continue to increase. The conventional method is to access the traffic first. The Waf security gateway, after filtering, forwards the traffic to the traffic gateway, and finally reaches the microservice gateway; Higress hopes that through the built-in Waf module, the user's request link can be simultaneously completed Waf protection, traffic distribution, and microservice governance only through Higress. It can improve the link RT and reduce the operation and maintenance complexity of the gateway. Therefore, Higress realizes the high integration capability of three-in-one traffic gateway + microservice gateway + security gateway.

## Why did Higress choose Envoy/Istio as the engine 

In the context of containerized cloud native, Kubernetes has become a standard interface between infrastructure and upper-layer applications.
