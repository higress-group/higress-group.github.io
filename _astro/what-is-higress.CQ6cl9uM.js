## Higress Introduction

Higress is a cloud-native API gateway with a kernel based on Istio and Envoy. It allows writing Wasm plugins using Go/Rust/JS and other languages, provides dozens of ready-to-use general-purpose plugins, and comes with an out-of-the-box console (click [here](http://demo.higress.io/) for a demo).

Higress was born within Alibaba to solve the issue of Tengine reload causing damage to long-connection services, as well as insufficient load balancing capabilities for gRPC/Dubbo.

Alibaba Cloud has built a cloud-native API gateway product based on Higress, providing 99.99% gateway high-availability guarantee service capabilities for a large number of enterprise customers.

Higress, with its AI gateway capabilities, supports AI services such as Tongyi Qianwen APP, Bailian large model API, and machine learning PAI platform. It also serves leading domestic AIGC enterprises (such as Zero One Infinite) and AI products (such as FastGPT).

### What is an AI Gateway

AI Gateway = AI Native API Gateway

The essence of an AI gateway remains an API gateway, with the significance of AI-native being that AI is a first-class citizen in such an API gateway. API development, API supply, API consumption, and API observation are all based on requirements in AI scenarios, evolving into entirely new capabilities.

These are the functional domains of traditional API gateways, which still have universal value in AI scenarios:

In AI scenarios, the functional domain of API gateways can be further expanded based on Higress:
